  Here are our different lists.
  
  ***JRname** is regular Python list. we can display it using meko:
  
  '${ JRname }'
  
  **family members list** was declared using 'variable name'. It's a    DAList which means we have access to some additional *methods*,    such as displaying the length of the list in words: 
  
  family members list has **$ { family members list.number_as_word() } ** items.
  
  and displaying its iteam in a more readable way:
  
  family memebers elements are: *${ family members list.comma_and_list() }*
  
  **The Homeless Providers List** is declared as a 'DAList' using an 'object' block. That means we also get access to the DAList the homeless providers list.
  
  The Homeless Providers List has **${ the homeless providers list. number_as_word()** items
  
  The Homeless Providers list elements are: *${ The homeless providers list.comma_and_list() }*
