# Displaying the questions without iteration
mandatory: True
question: Display without iteration
subquestion: |
 Without iteration we need to list the items out one by one
 
  - ${ JRfamily[0] }
  - ${ JRfamily[1] }
  - ${ JRfamily[2] }
  - ${ JRfamily[3] }
 
  It's inefficient - too much copy and pasting and difficult to modify.
  What happens if the number of items changes?

# Displaying with iteration is better

  Look how much less we're writing here!
  
  % for JRitem in JRfamily:
  - ${ JRitem }
  % endfor
  
  We can use the above three lines of code regardless of
  whether we have 5 or 500 items in our list.  This is a
  much more efficient way to store data

 Start off with the table header and then we use 
  iteration to supply the table body
  
  Item|Name
  ---|---
  % for JRitem in JRfamily:
  ${ loop.index + 1 }|${ JRitem }
  % endfor
  `loop.index` is a special Docassemble variable that only works in for loops.
  It gives you the index of the current element in the list.  Remember, we
  start counting from 0, so we need to add 1 to `loop.index` to give us the 
  information we're after.

 List items that end in a vowel.
  
  We use an if statement inside the for loop to select only the
  list items we want.
